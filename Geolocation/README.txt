In the index.html file, you need to replace the first script's "src" link's "key" request parameter
with your generated Google API key.

If you want to test out this application you need to have your own Google API key.

You can generate one by following the steps in the following link: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#creating-api-keys

Once your key is generated for your newly created project, you need to enable the "Places" API and "Maps JavaScript" API for that concrete project.

Once you have done that, just do the key replacement mentioned above and the app should work fine.
